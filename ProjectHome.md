Juggling Lab is an application for creating and animating juggling patterns. Its main goals are to help people learn juggling patterns, and to assist in inventing new ones.

This is an [Android](http://www.android.com/) port of the [desktop application](http://jugglinglab.sourceforge.net/) also called Juggling Lab.
